# Steganography On A BMP File

## What is 'Steganography'?
Steganography is an ancient practice of hiding messages in order to deliver information from one party to another confidentially. This practice has been replicated in modern times in different ways. 

## What does this program do?
In this small example, a [BMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) file has been modified to hide a secret message. The 'steg_encoder' encodes the message whereas 'steg_decoder' is used to decode it.

The program is a larger systems example to demonstrate input, output and memory manipulation in C.
